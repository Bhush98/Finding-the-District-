# Finding-the-District-
This is a classification problem where we have latitude and longitude of the hotel and we have to predict the district of hotel.

I have attached the dataset file as well.
This is just a simple classification problem using KNN you just need to know about libraries we have for machine learning.
If you are willing to start with machine learning.
